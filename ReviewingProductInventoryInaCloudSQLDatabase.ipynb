    "A _database_, at its core, is an organized collection of data. Databases are meant to be fast at retrieving, storing, and updating these collections. To help keep things organized, a database keeps related data in a collection called a _table_. Data is stored inside a table as _columns_ and _rows_. The _columns_ identify the data that is being stored in the table, and the _rows_ are the actual data itself. Refer to the figure below for a basic example of organized data inside the database, with rows and columns.\n",
